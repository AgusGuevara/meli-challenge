# meli-challenge

This is my take on Meli fullstack challenge!

To use : 

1 - git clone into your prefered folder.

2- once cloned, install dependencies for both backend and front end enviroments:

cd meli-challenge
cd backendmeli
npm i
cd ..
cd challenge
npm i

3- once everything is installed, in challenge folder run npm run runapp 

4 voila! enter localhost:3000 and start using the app.
